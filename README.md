# DAY-2  

## QUESTIONS:  
• You are given an integer array jobs, where jobs[i] is the amount of time it takes to complete the ith job.There are k workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to exactly one worker. The working time of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the maximum working time of any worker is minimized. Return the minimum possible maximum working time of any assignment.  
• On a social network consisting of m users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language. You are given an integer n, an array languages, and an array friendships where: There are n languages numbered 1 through n, languages[i] is the set of languages the ith user knows, and friendships[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a friendship between the users ui and vi. You can choose one language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return the minimum number of users you need to teach.  
• Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules: Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.  
• You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.  
• Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
